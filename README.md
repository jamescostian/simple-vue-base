This repo is for interviews. Candidates can clone it and get set up quickly before the interview, and when an interview starts, we give the candidate some code to put in here and work with. Production quality code and organization or not goals during interview challenges; this is slimmed-down to the bare-minimum of what you need during an interview, plus some things to make the development process smoother
